## Ruleset

### Qualifiers

1. There will be 4 map brackets, consisting of SV, Acc/Tech, Long Notes (LN), and speed.
2. **ScoreV2** will be used as the scoring system.
3. The Flashlight mod must be used by all participants. The only other mod allowed is Mirror.
4. Each participant will get 2 attempts at each map, only the best attempt for each map will count.
5. Each map will have its own leaderboard, and each participant's overall seed will be determined by the average of these ranks. The highest 32 seeds will proceed to the Group Stage.

### Group Stage

1. There will be 8 groups of 4 participants each.
2. Each group will be a single round-robin format, with each group member playing each other once.
3. The two best performing participants in each group will proceed to the Knockout Stage.
4. In order, the criteria for groups performance is as follows:
   1. Number of matches won
   2. Difference between number of maps won and number of maps lost
   3. Number of maps won
   4. Number of losses by default (lower is better)
   5. Higher qualification seed
5. The 16 participants advancing from the Group Stage will play in a double-elimination bracket to determine the winner.

### Match rules

1. The match lobby will be created and invites sent to participants 5-10 minutes prior to the match start time.
2. If a participant is more than 10 minutes late to the lobby, the participant inside the lobby will be declared the winner. If neither participant appears, the participant with the higher seed will be considered the winner.
3. Each participant will be allowed to select 1 map as a warmup. Warmups must be uploaded to the osu! servers and **cannot exceed 4 minutes** in length.
4. Participants can choose to ban 1 map from the mappool (excluding the tiebreaker). The pick/ban order is determined by the !roll command. The participant with the lower roll bans first and the other one with the higher roll picks first.
5. If both participants are tied on match point (e.g. 3-3 score in a Best-of-7), both participants will play the Tiebreaker bracket to determine the winner.
